# sandimations

Interactive, deterministic visual explanations of CyberSand performance techniques.

The project is intended to make spatial/temporal optimization strategies intuitive by letting a viewer slow, pause, step, inspect, perturb, and compare simulations rather than merely watching prerecorded animation.

## Initial visualization targets

1. **Chunk sleep / wake scheduling** — show settled regions becoming computationally dormant and disturbances waking only the necessary neighborhood.
2. **Phased sampling** — show active work distributed over spatial subsets and time while the macroscopic simulation remains continuous.
3. **Naive vs optimized comparison** — run identical seeded scenarios side by side and expose work avoided, active chunks, evaluated cells, divergence, and trace events.

## Core product requirements

- deterministic fixed-step simulation independent of rendering;
- pause, realtime, slow motion, fast-forward, single-phase stepping, single-frame stepping, and multi-frame stepping;
- typed live parameter registry with live-safe / next-step / reset-required mutation semantics;
- inspectable simulation, scheduler, and visualization state kept separate;
- structured trace/instrumentation events rather than visualization-owned algorithm logic;
- scenario/preset system with reproducible seeds and eventually shareable URLs;
- architecture that can later consume captured CyberSand traces or a real C++/WASM core without replacing the explanatory UI;
- accessibility, responsive presentation, and automated verification from the outset.
